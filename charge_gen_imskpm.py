Simulation of trEFM and  IM-SKPM responses:

(1) define generation rate (light intensity * absorption cross section)  G / cm^3/s

(2) define recombination kinetics (could be simple - k * N where k ~ 10^6 s-1, 
                                   or could add bimolecular terms - k2 * N**2 
                                   (but take k2 from our PL papers, e.g. Dane's Science)

(3) solve for N(t) given the G(t) function from the trEFM or IM-SKPM pulses.  
Here G(t) has a rise and fall slope that is given by the IRF of the source -- rather than being an ideal step.

(4) convert N(t) to  V(t) and d2C/dz^2  (V ~ log (N),  d2C/dz^2 as appropriate with charge density)

(5) convert V(t) and d2C/dz^2(t) to  signal(t) 
-- then apply ff-trEFM filter/processing, or lockin/FT and first harmonic extraction 
to simulate IM-SKPM and examine how IM-SKPM signal vs freq is affected by laser pulse rise time, 
and trEFM signal vs. laser pulse rise time affect thingsâ€¦compare to ideal square wave excitation
